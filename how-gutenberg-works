In **WordPress Gutenberg**, the interface is also organized into distinct **panels** and **work areas**, following a similar philosophy to Figma in terms of functionality and workflow. Here's how the Gutenberg panels can be categorized:

---

### **1. Canvas Area**
- **Purpose**: The main content editing area where users create and arrange blocks.
- **Elements**:
  - Editable content blocks (e.g., paragraphs, headings, images, etc.).
  - Drag-and-drop functionality for reordering blocks.
  - Real-time WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing.
- **Category**: **Workspace** (Primary Interaction Area).

---

### **2. Top Toolbar**
- **Purpose**: Provides global actions and quick access to key tools and settings.
- **Elements**:
  - **Add Block** button (+): For inserting new blocks.
  - Undo/Redo controls.
  - Tools for switching between select/edit modes.
  - Preview and Publish buttons.
- **Category**: **Global Actions** (Navigation and Workflow).

---

### **3. Sidebar Panels (Right Panel)**
- **Purpose**: Provides detailed controls and settings for the page or selected block.
- **Elements**:
  - **Document Settings**: Controls for the entire post/page, including:
    - Status & visibility (e.g., publish status, schedule).
    - Permalink settings.
    - Categories, tags, and featured image.
    - Revisions.
  - **Block Settings**: Contextual settings for the selected block, including:
    - Typography, alignment, and colors.
    - Advanced options like custom CSS classes.
- **Category**: **Contextual Settings** (Document-Level or Block-Level).

---

### **4. Block Inserter Panel (Left Sidebar or Floating)**
- **Purpose**: Provides access to all available blocks and reusable patterns.
- **Elements**:
  - Common blocks (e.g., paragraph, heading, image).
  - Widgets, embeds, and reusable block groups.
  - Patterns for pre-designed layouts.
- **Category**: **Block Management** (Building and Customization).

---

### **5. Block Toolbar (Floating Contextual Toolbar)**
- **Purpose**: Quick access to frequently used block-specific actions.
- **Elements**:
  - Alignment controls (left, right, center).
  - Bold, italic, and other inline text styling options.
  - Move up/down buttons for reordering blocks.
- **Category**: **Quick Actions** (Block-Level Controls).

---

### **6. List View Panel**
- **Purpose**: Provides an outline of all blocks in the current document, displayed hierarchically.
- **Elements**:
  - List of all blocks in the document.
  - Nesting structure for grouped or nested blocks (e.g., columns, groups).
  - Select and navigate directly to specific blocks.
- **Category**: **Content Structure** (Document Overview).

---

### **7. Footer Panel**
- **Purpose**: Displays document-wide feedback and progress information.
- **Elements**:
  - Word count, block count, and reading time.
  - Editing mode indicator (e.g., Visual Editor vs Code Editor).
- **Category**: **Progress and Context** (Document Feedback).

---

### **8. Sidebar Tabs**
- **Purpose**: Organizes different tools and features within the right panel.
- **Elements**:
  - Tabs for switching between **Document Settings** and **Block Settings**.
  - Possible extensions or third-party tools (e.g., Yoast SEO panel).
- **Category**: **Tool Extensions** (Modular Functionality).

---

### Organizational Philosophy:
- **Hierarchy**: The interface moves from **global actions** (Toolbar) to **document-wide settings** (Sidebar) and then to **block-specific controls** (Floating Toolbar).
- **Workflow-Centric**:
  - Users start by adding and arranging blocks in the Canvas.
  - Fine-tune individual blocks via the Right Sidebar or Floating Toolbar.
  - Adjust global document settings in the Sidebar.
- **Modularity**: Panels are organized so users can focus on specific tasks (e.g., editing, styling, or publishing) without clutter.

---

### Key Differences from Figma:
- **Block-Based Workflow**: Gutenberg is tailored for content creation with reusable building blocks, whereas Figma focuses on design and prototyping.
- **Less Real-Time Collaboration**: While Figma emphasizes collaboration, Gutenberg prioritizes content publishing workflows.
- **Contextual Tooling**: Gutenberg dynamically shows options relevant to the selected block or document context.

---

In summary, Gutenberg's panels are organized to reflect a **block-first, document-oriented workflow**, making it easy for users to build content piece by piece while maintaining flexibility for both global and local adjustments.
