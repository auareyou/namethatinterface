Choosing between a **modal window** (dialog) and an **in-context fly-out panel** depends on the specific user experience and interaction goals. Here’s when to use each:

### Use a **modal window/dialog** when:
1. **Critical decisions** are required:
   - If the user must make a choice or confirm an action before continuing (e.g., confirmation prompts for deletion).
   - For actions that cannot be undone or are important enough to demand the user’s full attention (e.g., terms of service agreements, warnings, or errors).

2. **Blocking actions** are needed:
   - When users should focus on completing the task without interacting with the rest of the UI until they close the modal.
   - For actions that impact other parts of the interface, and you want to prevent interaction with those areas until the task is resolved (e.g., payment submission, form completions).

3. **Focus on a single task** is required:
   - If the user needs to provide or view detailed information without distractions (e.g., a form requiring attention or steps that need to be completed before progressing).
   - When isolating content is necessary to ensure it stands out and can be handled immediately.

4. **Urgency or priority** is emphasized:
   - Use when you want to convey a sense of importance or urgency about the content, making it impossible for the user to proceed without addressing the modal’s content.

### Use a **fly-out panel** when:
1. **Non-blocking information** or options are provided:
   - When the user can continue interacting with the rest of the interface while the panel is open (e.g., quick settings, filters, or a user profile view).
   - For actions that don’t require confirmation before proceeding but provide more detailed information or additional controls (e.g., edit options or extended filters).

2. **Contextual actions** or content:
   - Fly-out panels are useful when the content is related to the current page or workflow (e.g., displaying additional details about an item without leaving the page).
   - It’s a good choice when users might want to reference or interact with other parts of the interface while using the panel.

3. **Persistent or secondary actions**:
   - When the interaction is secondary to the main task or when the user might want to toggle it open or closed frequently (e.g., a notification drawer or a messaging interface).
   - For optional, non-disruptive information or actions that don’t demand full attention.

---

### Summary:
- **Modal window**: Use when you need to interrupt and force the user to focus on a critical, time-sensitive, or important task.
- **Fly-out panel**: Use when offering supplementary, non-disruptive information or actions that can coexist with the main content.
